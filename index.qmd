Welcome to my website! When I'm not in the mountains, I'm fine tuning my data science skills.

I decided to pursue my master's degree in data science (MSDS) at [CU Boulder](https://www.colorado.edu/) to eventually have a career that combines two of my passions; the preservation and science of earth and the fascinating study of big data.

Prior to this, I worked as a Benefits Data Analyst in the insurance industry. Initially, I had actuarial aspirations, inspired by my time at the [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/), where I studied mathematics (Bachelor of Arts in Mathematics, minor in Applied Mathematics).

Small scale automation projects during my time as a Benefits Data Analyst helped me start to develop a programming repertoire. I kept building the programming toolkit, eventually merging this with my passion for mathematics, and ultimately leading me down the data science pathway.

I hope you will enjoy reviewing my projects in Data Science and Math. Thank you for your time and please contact me with any questions!
