Welcome to my website! When I'm not in the mountains, I'm fine tuning my data science skills.

I decided to pursue my master's degree in data science (MSDS) at [CU Boulder](https://www.colorado.edu/) to apply my passions for mathematics and programming in an interdisciplinary setting which is known for exposure in the Earth and natural sciences, among other fascinating and complex subjects.

Prior to this, I worked as a Benefits Data Analyst in the insurance industry. Initially, I had actuarial aspirations, inspired by my time at the [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/), where I studied mathematics (Bachelor of Arts in Mathematics, minor in Applied Mathematics).

Small scale automation projects during my time as a Benefits Data Analyst helped me start to develop a programming repertoire. I kept building the programming toolkit, eventually merging this with my passion for mathematics, and ultimately leading me down the data science pathway.

During my time at CU Boulder, I've excelled at applying statistical theory, data mining, and machine learning algorithms; all of which can be viewed throughout my showcased projects and GitHub repositories.

Feel free to peruse my projects and GitHub repositories. Thanks for visiting, and please don't hesitate to reach out with any questions!
