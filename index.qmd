Welcome to my website! When I'm not in the mountains, I'm fine tuning my data science skills.

I'm currently pursuing my master's degree in data science (MSDS) at [CU Boulder]("https://www.colorado.edu/").

Prior to this, I worked as a Benefits Data Analyst in the insurance industry. Initially, I had actuarial aspirations, inspired by my time at the [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/), where I studied mathematics (Bachelor of Arts in Mathematics, minor in Applied Mathematics).

Small scale automation projects during my time as a Benefits Data Analyst helped me start to develop a programming repertoire. I kept building the programming toolkit, eventually merging this with my passion for mathematics, ultimately leading me down a data science pathway.
