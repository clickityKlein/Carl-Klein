### Benefits Data Analyst
#### 2018 - 2023

My first career experience after finishing my undergraduate degree. During this time, I provided analytical insights and financial reports to multiple clients, all while building a network and learning about professionalism.

**Key Tasks and Accomplishments:**

- Updated and monitored financial and health data used in conducting analyses to identify trends, discrepancies, 
and produce recommendations.
- Leveraged findings during the renewal process and utilized data to negotiate premiums with insurance carriers.
- Communicated key metrics and statistics by preparing and presenting periodic reports for clients.
- Automated internal tasks by creating VBA macros and scripts.

Small scale automation projects during my time as a Benefits Data Analyst helped me start to develop my programming repertoire, and a few of the generic models I built prior to implementing in my work can be found [here](/posts/all/vba-projects/index.qmd).
