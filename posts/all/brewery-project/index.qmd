Utilized data mining techniques to prepare, clean, and apply data scraped and aggregated from multiple sources to ultimately create models important for brewers and brewery customers to make informed decisions.

My team, consisting of three members, performed a full data science life cycle process to help multiple facets of the brewery community make informed decisions. After scraping data and using APIs, this data was cleaned, prepared and then modeled. Several different ideas were tested through exploratory data analysis and the modeling. The modeling consisted of hypertuning parameters.
