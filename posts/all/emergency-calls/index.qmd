With such a massive amount of well-maintained information available, this provided an opportunity to dive into what goes on when a police assistance call is placed. Specifically, we looked at:

- What times were the majority of the calls placed? Are there any surges by day of the month, or month of the year?
- Do the amount of calls change by Precinct, Sector or Beat?
- Does the Priority of calls change by Precinct, Sector or Beat?
- The Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) system assigns Priority. Can we create a model which accurately predicts Priority?

*Please see the GitHub repo and Medium articles for complete findings.*
