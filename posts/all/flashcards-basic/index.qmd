*Actually, one of my first completed object oriented programming projects.*

This project allows a user to create flashcards and decks of flashcards. It is meant to be a virtual replacement to physical flashcards, and features abilities such as deck combination and shuffling.

It was imperative to include the SymPy library, as this will personally be used heavily for mathematical concepts. On another personal note, further motivation for developing this into some sort of application was to swap mindless scrolling with learning during downtime.
