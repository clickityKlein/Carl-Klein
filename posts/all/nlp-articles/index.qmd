The goal of this project was to attempt to create an NLP model which could correctly identify the publisher given an article.

After cleaning and exploring the data via statistical and visual methods, attempt to create a classification model which will accurately predict publisher if given a news article.

Without higher processing power, and a more equipt dataset, this will likely not be very accurate. Additionally, this only accounts for a small portion of the thousands of publishers and news networks, which means any article from outside the publishers in this dataset will result in an incorrect prediction.

Overall, we were able to successfully clean and analyze a dataset surrounding our goal. After testing several models and parameters, there was a "best" model built. The f1-scores and accuracy were not ideal, however, the framework to continue to improve this model has been created!

When it comes to potential improvements of this analysis and model, at the top of the list is obviously creating more accurate predictions. A starting point would be to perform a more robust parameter search. Given the proper hardware, it would be great to test the entire dataset (~150,000 articles) across not only each of the classifiers, but a grid search of parameters for each of the classifiers as well.

Unfortunately, the instance of testing just the 3 max_depth parameters for the Random Forest Classifier on less than 10,000 rows of data took about 2 hours on the machine it was performed on. Maybe another machine is better equipt to take on the challenge!
